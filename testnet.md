---

The charybdis project operates both a public, mostly-open linking testnet and a sandbox server for people who want to experiment with charybdis.

## TestNet

Round-robin is available at `irc.charybdis.io` port 6667 for plaintext and port 9999 for TLS.

### TestNet servers

 * `jaguar.dereferenced.org`

### Linking to TestNet

To link to the testnet, just ask at `#testnet` on `irc.charybdis.io`.  We will delink your server if you cause trouble though, so please don't.

## Sandbox

The charybdis sandbox is available at `sandbox.charybdis.io`.  You can oper up as an admin by using `/oper oper oper`.

Please do not allow your usage of the sandbox to interrupt others' usage of the sandbox.  Doing so will result in you being blocked from using
the sandbox (via network-level firewall if necessary).
